Cub3D is a team project in the **42 curriculum** and aims to teach students about game development, graphics programming, and parsing.

<blockquote>
cub3D is a 3D maze game developed using the miniLibX graphics library. The game uses raycasting techniques to render a 3D view of a maze and allows the player to navigate through it using arrow keys and WASD keys. The game features wall textures that vary based on the direction of the wall, floor and ceiling color customization, and the ability to read a scene description file to generate different maps.
